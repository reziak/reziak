### Hi there, I'm Bruno ğŸ‘‹

My current stack is frontend with React, Typescript, Redux, and a mix of css post-processors and css-in-js.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Remixjs**, and a little more about backend with **Nestjs**
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: bruno.padovan@gmail.com

- âš¡ Fun fact: I know how to create completely useless DnD and Pathfinder 2 characters.
